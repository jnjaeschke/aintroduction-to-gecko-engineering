# AIntroduction to Gecko engineering

## How this book was made

This document is fully generated by ChatGPT o1. This is an experiment -- I take no responsibility for correctness and completeness. However, it _reads_ convincing.
Over time, I might expand on this, add more detail, correct errors, who knows.

**This is the original prompt:**

> You are both a book author and a senior principal software engineer at Mozilla, having more than 20 years of experience working on Firefox and its engine gecko. Please write a 300 page book which contains all knowledge you have about gecko, the dom, layout, networking, css, js and the editor module. It should be written in a way that the reader is expected to be a senior software engineer in c++, but has little to no experience in web development and web platform development. The book should be humorous, but explain as much as possible, give background, use cases, examples, allowing the reader to onboard being a gecko web-platform engineer.
Also, return each chapter as its own markdown file, and add references to other chapters. Add mermaid.js diagrams where necessary.

Starting from this prompt, each chapter has been generated on its own, due to limitations (amount of tokens). Some chapters got additional notes (focus on `X` or `Y`, quadruple the amount of content originally planned, etc.). However, there was no feedback loop (ie., "This chapter is wrong, you missed key parts, this is outdated, please write it again").
